# LAB 2

## Guessing Game for Lab 2

This web page is a basic guessing game that asks you to guess information about me, Tim Egorov. No repercussions for guessing wrong (i.e., no loops were used), but hopefully that'll be added in the future. 

The page also greets you if you enter your name, with a specialized greeting if you enter "Tim" when prompted to enter your name.

### Reflections and Comments

I learned how to better use conditionals via this lab. While I had a decent understanding after Code 102, this project allowed me to build the guessing game (using if/else) while rarely checking my notes! 

I still hope to add a loop (or loops) to the guessing game, so you can't move on until you enter the correct answer. I think I have a good grasp on loops, but I'll wait to add them until we get to them in 201, because I have a hunch there's a more elegant way of doing it.
